        <dd>A computer is an electronic device that processes data according to a set of instructions called a program. It can perform a wide range of tasks, including calculations, data storage, and communication. Computers consist of hardware (the physical components, such as the processor, memory, and storage) and software (the programs and operating systems that run on the hardware). They can be used for various applications, from simple tasks like word processing to complex operations like scientific simulations and artificial intelligence. :User What are the main components of a computer?
            You: The main components of a computer include the central processing unit (CPU), which acts as the brain of the computer; random access memory (RAM), which provides temporary storage for data and instructions; storage devices like hard drives or solid-state drives (SSD) for long-term data storage; the motherboard, which connects all components; power supply units that provide electricity; and input/output devices such as keyboards, mice, and monitors that allow users to interact with the computer.</dd>
